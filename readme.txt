== Description ==

If you have one of the brand plugins running, think of this as a way to show products on the page that are tied to that brand.  
After activation, insert the shortcode [wc_by_brands brands="puma,nike" limit="8"] The containers have default woocommerce classes, and will integrate the same woocommerce styling.

This plugin was created because of some woocommerce stores that were already running a brands plugin of some kind, but there wasn't shortcode to display products tied to that brand. It was either go through the products and give all of them a tag, or setup this plugin to do that work for us.
